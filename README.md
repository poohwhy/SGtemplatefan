Home Assistant fan template scripts for Singapore market fans

The Home Assistant template fan integration is extremely useful but it does not have the best write up to understand how it works. A guide by Chris Lim on HA forums was a great benefit in understanding how it works: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/guide-template-fan-and-broadlink/323488

However, the guide is not targeted at fans most commonly available in the Singapore market (IR/RF controlled, controlled with off - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 or similar settings). I'm sharing my configuration in the hope that this will help someone integrate their fans into HA.

The config is meant for a fan with memory function connected to a smart switch, with speed controls via IR/RF remote.
